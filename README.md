## User stories:  
As a developer, if I don’t know what Lemonade Stand game is, I will play the game online for a bit to get familiar with the gameplay.  
- (5 points): As a developer, I want to make good, consistent commits.  
- (25 points): As a player, I want the basic Lemonade Stand gameplay to be present.   
- (10 points): As a player, I want a weather system that includes a forecast and actual weather, so that I can get a predicted forecast for a day or week and then what the actual weather is on the given day.  
- (10 points): As a player, the price of product as well as weather/temperature should affect demand, so that if the price is too high, sales will decrease, or if the price is too low, sales will increase, etc.  
- (10 points): As a player, I want each customer to be a separate object with its own chance of buying a glass of lemonade, so that how much lemonade is purchased and how much a customer is willing to pay will vary from customer to customer.  
- (5 points): As a player, I want the ability to make a recipe for my lemonade, so that I can include x-amount of lemons, x-amount of sugar, and x-amount of ice.  
- (10 points): As a player, I want my game to be playable for at least seven days.  
- (10 points): As a player, I want my daily profit or loss displayed at the end of each day, so that I know how much money my lemonade stand has made. I also want my total profit or loss to be a running total that is displayed at the end of each day, so that I know how much money my lemonade stand has made.  
- (10 points): As a developer, I want to implement the SOLID design principles as well as C# best practices in my project, so that project is as well-designed as possible.  
- (10 points (5 points each)): As a developer, I want to pinpoint at least two places where I used one of the SOLID design principles and discuss my reasoning, so that I can properly understand good code design. Minimum of two SOLID design principles must be used.  
- (10 points) As a developer, I want to connect my console application to a database so that I can save “high scores” in the form of a player’s name and their final score (profit).  
Database Hint: SqlConnection class  

## Bonus Points:  
- (5 points): As a player, I want the game to be playable for more than one player, so that I can have multiple humans play each other or a human play a computer.  
- (5 points) As a developer, I want to integrate a Weather API, so that my game has real-time weather based on a current temperature and forecast.
